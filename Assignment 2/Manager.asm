;Program information
;  Program name: Sum of an Array
;  Programming languages: One modules in C, one in C++ and three modules in X86
;  Date program began:     2020-Sept-27
;  Date program completed: 2020-Oct-3
;  Files in this program: Main.c, Manager.asm, Display_Array.cpp, Sum.asm, Input_Array.asm r.sh
;  Status: Complete.  No errors found after extensive testing.
;
;
;Purpose
;  Takes in user input of integers and stores them into an array before returning the size of the array.
